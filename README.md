This repository was created for an assessment in a PHP class at my university

The exercises are:

1) Create an HTML page with form fields in which the user enters two values, m and n, which must be submitted to the server via the GET method. You must create a PHP script that retrieves these two parameters, m and n, and returns to the user the GCD and LCM of these two numbers. You can use Euclid's algorithm to calculate the GCD.

2) Create an HTML page with form fields in which the user enters two values ​​m and n that must be submitted to the server via the POST method. You must create a PHP script that retrieves these two parameters m and n and stores them in an array m multiples of n and displays this array to the user.
